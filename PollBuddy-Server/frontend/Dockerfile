# This dockerfile is considered "production ready" so we're compiling and building the app rather than running it in
# dev mode. This grants us a few optimizations desirable in a production environment.

# Build Stage 1 - Used to transpile and minimize
FROM node:current AS builder

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install app dependencies

# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
# where available (npm@5+)
COPY package*.json ./

# Instead of npm install, we're using npm ci which uses package-lock.json instead of package.json for more reproducible
# builds and for performance. We also won't be needing dev dependencies here so those are omitted.
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Bundle app source
# Folders
COPY public ./public
COPY src ./src
# Files
COPY .env ./

# Build command
RUN npm run build



# Build Stage 2 - Run previously built files
FROM node:current-alpine
WORKDIR /usr/src/app/

# Install serve to serve the files
RUN npm install -g serve

# Bundle app source from builder
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/build ./build

# Port
EXPOSE 3000

# Start command
CMD ["serve", "-s", "build", "-l", "3000"]
