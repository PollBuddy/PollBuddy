Poll Buddy is dedicated to transparency and trust. As a part of our commitment to provide the highest quality user experience, Poll Buddy prioritizes your privacy. Poll Buddy protects user data and confidential information to the maximum extent possible. Your personal information is collected on an as-needed basis and is not actively shared with anyone, except where explicitly allowed by you. Data is stored on a private web server with restricted access privileges.

Poll Buddy needs to collect certain information in order to deliver a functional product. Some examples of this may include:

- Internet Protocol (IP) address of computer being used
- Web pages requested
- Browser used
- Date and Time

Additionally, you may choose to log in via RPI’s CAS. In this case, the CAS identification number is also collected.

Personally identifiable data, such as name and email, are collected via user input. Cookies may be used to keep track of the user’s session. Poll Buddy may also collect IP addresses and browser information for anti-cheating functionality. This data is used only for Poll Buddy related functions, and none of the information is sold or shared with anyone else.

Poll Buddy’s main function is to collect user answers to questions, and will only collect as much information is necessary to provide the site’s functionality. Information inputted by the user is stored potentially indefinitely, but you do have the option to request timely deletion of your data.
