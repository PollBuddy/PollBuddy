# Welcome to Poll Buddy!
# An affordable and compatible in-class quizzing platform.

Many professors use iClickers in the classroom to create polls, ask questions, take attendance, and quiz their students. Unfortunately, these devices come with many drawbacks:
- Expensive
- Limited to five buttons (A, B, C, D, E)
- Bulky
- Outdated
- Students are susceptible to forgetting bring them to class
- Difficult to integrate with other programs
- Only professors can track answers

And the list goes on...

As a group of RPI students fed up with iClickers we decided to create Poll Buddy; a website that shares all the same functionality of iClickers, but can do so much more while solving all of these problems.

Poll Buddy is a website that professors can use to interact with their students during class. Professors will log in to their Poll Buddy account and will be able to create questions. Students will log in to their own accounts where they can view the current question and answer options. Students can receive credit for correctly answering the question. Both professors and students will then be able to view question results and other statistics.
