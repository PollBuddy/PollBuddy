# **Welcome to Poll Buddy!**
#### An affordable and compatible in-class quizzing platform. If you are a student, please ask your instructor for a link, or "Poll Code" in order to join their group and answer questions.
# **How does Poll Buddy work?**
#### Poll Buddy operates through the use of groups. Groups are collections of users that have access to a restricted set of polls. You can create a group by:
1. *Using the "MENU" dropdown on the top-left, and select "GROUPS".*
2. *Select "CREATE NEW GROUP" and fill out the name and description.*
#### In each group, you can create polls, which are sets of questions which members can use. To make one, you must:
1. *Select "CREATE NEW POLL" in the "GROUPS" page and fill out the title and description.*
2. *You can create the questions for your poll by selecting "NEW QUESTION".*
#### You can invite your students to answer the poll questions by providing them with the poll code. You can get this poll code from the url in your group or edit page. For example, https://pollbuddy.app/polls/<your code here>.
#### You can also invite students to your group by giving them a group code, with the method as above.
